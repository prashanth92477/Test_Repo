1. Add a button which say 'Display Details'
2. Add a paragraph with any content of you choice(e.g 'Secret Password=tuna')
3. Toggle the displaying of that paragraph with button created in the first step
4.  Log all button clicks in an array and ouput that array below the secret paragraph( maybe log a timestamp or simply an incrementing number)
5. Starting at the 5th log item, give all future log items a blue background (via ngStyle) and white color(ngClass).
